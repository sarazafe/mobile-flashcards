# Mobile Flashcards Project

This project is the third project that I have to do for passing the _Udacity_'s _React Nanodegree_. 
It consists of developing a game that allows the users to add decks with cards. 
Each card will have a question and an answer. 
Then, they can start a quiz for each deck. 
The quiz consists of showing the question, and when the user desires, 
he can check the answer and determines if she/he got a right or a wrong result.

    * For an easy way to test the code, it can be possible to launch with _expo_ as folows: `expo start`
